## Blast Image Config v3.X Workflow Preferences, by Justin Elliott <jde6@psu.edu>

## See here for online documentation:

## 		http://clc.its.psu.edu/UnivServices/itadmins/mac/blastimageconfig/workflowprefsettings
		
## Lines starting with '#' are treated as comments.
## Lines in this example file starting with two #'s are comments and not key value pairs.
## All Keys are in caps with no spaces, followed by the equals sign and then the value.

## All Key lines are commented out with a single Hash '#' at the start of each line. Ie:

## KEY_NAME COMMENTS HERE.
# KEY_NAME=VALUE

# To enable a Key value pair simply remove the '#', like the next key 'NUMBER_OF_LOGS_TO_KEEP' is below:

## --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# FW_PASSWD_MODE=USEADMIN

## -------------------------------------------------------

## Options for PRE_RESTORE_SCRIPT:
## This can be the name of anything that can run from the command line. Ie, scripts, binaries, etc.
## Note: BIC will change the mode (chmod) of the specified script to be executable and will run it via 'sudo' (root) admin rights.
## 	PRE_RESTORE_SCRIPT=<NameOfScript>
# PRE_RESTORE_SCRIPT=NameOfScriptHere.pl

## If not specified, the default "Automatic" network location name will be used.
# DEFAULT_NETWORK_LOCATION_NAME=NameOfNetworkLocation

## Options for CREATE_NEW_NETWORK_PREFS_FILE:
##  YES = Delete the existing network preferences file, which will create a completely new one.
##  NO = Update the existing network preferences file. Use this setting for most environments!
# CREATE_NEW_NETWORK_PREFS_FILE=NO

## Options for NETWORK_CONFIG (of the Mac's 'Built-in Ethernet' or 'Ethernet' NIC):
## 	DO_NOT_CHANGE = Do not change the network settings.
##  DHCP = Configure the Ethernet NIC for DHCP (IPv4).
##  SET_IP = Configure the Ethernet NIC for Static IPv4 Settings. This will prompt the user for the information.
# NETWORK_CONFIG=DHCP

## DEFAULT_IP:
## NOTE: This key is read if the 'NETWORK_CONFIG' key = 'SET_IP':
## Enter in the IP address here to help speed up entering it. Add at least 1, 2, 3 or all 4 octets.
# DEFAULT_IP=123.123.123.123

## Options for DEFAULT_SUBNET:
## NOTE: This key is read if the 'NETWORK_CONFIG' key = 'SET_IP':

## MATCH_IP: The router IP will be automatically filled in as the IP address is, except for the last octet.
## You can also set the DEFAULT_ROUTER to an IP address but it must have the same number of IP octets that the DEFAULT_IP has.
## Set the value to 'MATCH_IP' and as you enter in the IP address the router IP will automatically fill in each 
## respective octet to match the IP octet. Saves a little time when entering IP configurations. You can also specify the
## full IP address if desired. Be aware that specifying the router IP requires that the DEFAULT_IP is also specified and
## that it has the same number of octets specified.
# DEFAULT_ROUTER=MATCH_IP
# DEFAULT_ROUTER=123.123.123.123

## Options for DNS_SERVER1:
## Note: Ignored if NETWORK_CONFIG is "DHCP" or "DO_NOT_CHANGE"

##       The version of Mac OS X on the restored disk is ALSO at Mac OS X 10.4.7 or higher.
## YES = If an AirPort/Wi-Fi card is installed, enable it as one of the network interfaces.
## NO  = Turn off/Disable the AirPort/Wi-Fi card. Will not error out if the AirPort/Wi-Fi card does or does not exist.
# ENABLE_AIRPORT=YES

## -------------------------------------------------------

## SKIP_NETWORK_NAMES: Do you want to skip setting the network names?
##  YES = Do not ask to configure the network names.
##  NO = Prompt the user to configure the network names. Most environments will use this setting.
# SKIP_NETWORK_NAMES=YES

## Options for COMPUTER_NAME:
## NOTE: This key is read if the 'SKIP_NETWORK_NAMES' key does not equal 'YES':
## MAXIMUM length is 63 Characters, and not these characters: "@", "=", ":"
## Use {$IP} to insert the Mac's full IP address when using a static IP configuration.
## Use {$IP1} , {$IP2} , {$IP3} or {$IP4} for each of the for IP octets.
## Use {$SN} to insert the Mac's Hardware Serial Number. Very helpful to avoid network name conflicts!
## COMPUTER_NAME=Mac.{$IP}
## COMPUTER_NAME=Mac.{$IP1}.{$IP2}.{$IP3}.{$IP4}
# COMPUTER_NAME=My Mac {$SN}

## Options for LOCAL_NAME:

## Use {$IP} to insert the Mac's IP address when using a static IP configuration
## LOCAL_NAME=Mac-{$IP}
## LOCAL_NAME=Mac-{$IP1}-{$IP2}-{$IP3}-{$IP4}
## Use {$SN} to insert the Mac's Hardware Serial Number. Very helpful to avoid network name conflicts!
# LOCAL_NAME=My-Mac-{$SN}

## IGNORE_NETWORK_NAME_ERRORS: If auto-running, do you want BIC to stop and report issues with the network names that were configured?
## NOTE: This key is read if the 'SKIP_NETWORK_NAMES' key does not equal 'YES':
# IGNORE_NETWORK_NAME_ERRORS=YES or NO

## -------------------------------------------------------

## Options for DEFAULT_DISK_IMAGE:
## 	<NameOfImage>
# DEFAULT_DISK_IMAGE=Your-OSX-Master-System-Image.dmg

## STOP_IMAGE_RESTORE_IF_NOT_ASR_SCANNED: Introduced in BIC version 2.9.3b2.
## Setting this to 'YES' will force BIC to stop and warn the user if the system disk image to restore has not been properly scanned for restore. If a disk image has not been 'scanned for restore' (checksums added) the time to restore the image will be MUCH, MUCH SLOWER.
##  YES = Do not restore the image, stop and inform the user. This is the recommended default to use for all environments.
##  NO = Do not check if the image was 'scanned for restore.' Do not use this setting unless you really need to do so.
# STOP_IMAGE_RESTORE_IF_NOT_ASR_SCANNED=YES

## BIC_IGNORE_DISK_FLAG_FILE: Introduced in BIC version 2.9.3b2.
## To help prevent accidentally erasing disk volumes that you NEVER want BIC to touch,
## BIC will now check this setting for a value, and if it's not set, it will use the default
## setting and always check for the .BlastImageConfigIgnoreThisVolume file at the root of 
## each mounted disk.
## Notice that filenames that start with a 'dot' character prevents the Finder from displaying it.
# BIC_IGNORE_DISK_FLAG_FILE=.NameOfTheFileYouWantExample

## STOP_RESTORE_IF_MULTIPLE_DISKS_FOUND:
## When auto-running, do you want BIC to stop if more than one valid restore disk is found?
##  YES = Stop the restore if more than one disk volume is found.
##  NO = Don't stop if more than one disk is found.
# STOP_RESTORE_IF_MULTIPLE_DISKS_FOUND=YES

## RESTORE_TO_INTERNAL_VOLUMES_ONLY: New as of BIC version 2.9.1rc1.
## When set to 'YES' BIC will only restore to internal disk volumes of the Mac it's running on.
## This helps to prevent accidental erasure of external student scratch disks, USB flash drives, etc.
##  YES = Only allow restoring to internal disk volumes. Recommended default for most environments unless you are restoring external disks or Macs mounted in target disk mode.
##  NO = Restore to internal or externally mounted disks.
# RESTORE_TO_INTERNAL_VOLUMES_ONLY=YES

## Options for EXCLUDE_BOOT_DISK_VOLUMES:
## Note: If this is key is not set to 'YES' then all found disk images will be added to the list of disks to restore to.
##  YES = Do not include the other volumes on the boot disk. Ie, the disk you've booted the Mac with has multiple partitions and you do not want to include the other partitions in the list of disks to restore to.
##  NO = Add all found partitions on the boot disk.
# EXCLUDE_BOOT_DISK_VOLUMES=YES

## CREATE_SINGLE_PARTITION:
## Do you want BIC to create one single partition on the parent disk of the selected restore volume?
##  YES = Repartition the parent disk of the volume selected to restore. Ie, erase all other partitions on the parent disk and create one, single partition to restore to.
##  NO = Do not repartition the parent disk of the disk volume selected.
# CREATE_SINGLE_PARTITION=NO

## ZERO_ERASE_RESTORE_DISK: Added in BIC version 2.9.0rc2.
## Used to do a 'secure erase' of the selected restore disk. Note that this process will take hours in most cases.
##  YES = Zero out (secure erase) the selected disk before the master disk image is restored.
##  NO = Do not zero out the selected disk volume to restore.
# ZERO_ERASE_RESTORE_DISK=NO

## Options for RESTORE_FIRST_DISK:
## 	YES = Restore to the first disk in the 'Disk To Restore' to pop-up menu. Use this setting when auto-running.
##  NO = Wait for the user to select the disk to restore to. Safer, but slows down the process a bit when auto-running.
# RESTORE_FIRST_DISK=NO

## Option for ASR's "verify" stage: ENABLE_VERIFICATION:
## 	YES = Tell asr to verify the disk data that was restored. Note that this requires that the image was 'scanned for restore' and will greatly increase the time it takes to restore the image, BUT guarantees that the data written matches what is in your master disk image.
##  NO = Tell asr to only restore the data and not verify it. This is recommended really only for non-personal Macs and NOT for personal company staff computers.
# ENABLE_VERIFICATION=YES

## Options for ASR_TIMEOUT_MINUTES: (0 = Unlimited)
# ASR_TIMEOUT_MINUTES=0

## Options for DEBUG_SKIP_RESTORE_BUTTON:
## Added with BIC version 2.9.0rc1. 
## If not autorunning, and the value is YES, allows for testing post restore scripts, no waiting for image to fully restore.
##  YES = Display the 'Skip Restore TEST' checkbox. This is useful for when testing and you don't want to restore the system image and the 'Disk To Restore' is a disk volume with a VALID OS X system installation. This is useful to save time when you want to test post restore scripts and applying network settings, etc. WARNING! Before using the workflow in a production environment turn this key to "NO" and do a full test restore.
##  NO = Do not display the "Skip Restore TEST" checkbox. This is the recommended default.
# DEBUG_SKIP_RESTORE_BUTTON=NO

## Options for PAUSE_ON_RESTORE:
## set this to YES if you want everything EXCEPT for the restore dialog to autorun
## 	YES = Pause on the restore disk stage. This is the safest option, recommended when you are testing.
##  NO = If auto-running - and all previous key conditions have been satisfied - do the restore!
# PAUSE_ON_RESTORE=YES

## PAUSE_AFTER_RESTORE: Added with BIC version 2.9.1rc2.
## Regardless if auto-running or not, BIC will only pause after the restore if this is set to 'YES'.
##  YES = Wait for the user to click the 'Next' button after the restore has finished.
##  NO = Automatically go to the next stage after the restore has completed.
# PAUSE_AFTER_RESTORE=YES

## -------------------------------------------------------

## Options for BLESS_RESTORED_DISK:
## Should the restored disk be bootable? In most cases, this should be 'YES'
## 	YES = Bless the restored disk, which makes it bootable. This is the recommended default for all environments.
##  NO = Do not enable the disk for booting. This is NOT recommended.
# BLESS_RESTORED_DISK=YES

## Options for SET_FW_BOOT:
## Should the Open Firmware/EFI boot device be set to the restored disk?
## In most cases, you want this to be YES. If Open Firmware/EFI security is enabled, 
## and this is set to NO, it's possible that the Mac will not allow the booting from the restored disk.
##  YES = Change the 'Startup Disk' setting to use the restored disk. This is the recommended default.
## 	NO = Do not change the 'Startup Disk' to the restored disk. Not recommended for most cases, unless you are restoring a lot of external disks that you never want to boot your Mac from.
# SET_FW_BOOT=YES

## -------------------------------------------------------

## Options for POST_RESTORE_SCRIPT:
## This can be the name of anything that can run from the command line. Ie, scripts, binaries, etc.
## Note: BIC will change the mode (chmod) of the specified script to be executable and will run it via 'sudo' (root) admin rights.
## 	<NameOfScript>
# POST_RESTORE_SCRIPT=NameOfScriptHere.pl

## Options for LOG_POST_RESTORE_SCRIPT_OUTPUT:
##  YES = Log the output of the post restore script.
##  NO = Do NOT log the output of the post restore script.
# LOG_POST_RESTORE_SCRIPT_OUTPUT=NO

## Set the number of minutes to wait until reporting an error for the POST_RESTORE_SCRIPT:
# POST_RESTORE_SCRIPT_TIMEOUT_MINUTES=NumberOfMinutes

## -------------------------------------------------------

## Options for ENDING_TASK: (Restart and Shutdown are graceful, via an AppleScript event sent to the Finder as of BIC 3.0.)
## 	QUIT, RESTART, SHUTDOWN
# ENDING_TASK=RESTART

## --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Make sure that the last key value pair ends with a hard return!

## EOF
